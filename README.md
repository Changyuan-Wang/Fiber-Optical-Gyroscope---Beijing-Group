# List of Components

- A turntable [two choices]:
  * Lazy susan (~¥100)
    + most of the lazy susans can not rotate very fast.
  * We made one with small turntable and cardboard.
- Manual 3-Paddle Fiber Polarization Controller [1310nm] (~¥400)
- 1310nm 5mW FP SM Laser Diode (~¥100)
- 
- 
- Labjack HV

Note:
All of the components are bought in Beijing, China, so their prices are typically cheaper than in the United States. Here is an example purchase link that include most of the components for people in the US: https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=343.

# Design


# Building Process
Tips:
1. Selecting fibers and adapters - all single mode, all the same light range (e.g. 1310nm), all FC/APC
2. Stablization (battery - buck converter, the whole system - all the fiber/etc, because they are sensitive)
